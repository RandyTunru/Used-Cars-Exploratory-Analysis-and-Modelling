# Used Cars Exploratory Analysis and Modelling

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modelling for used car sales data. The goal is to uncover insights and build models to estimate car prices and identify key factors affecting value.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modelling
- `environment.yaml` - YAML file for conda environment
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (visualizations, statistics)
- Feature engineering
- Regression model to predict price
- Model evaluation

## What I've Learned

- Handle raw data with outliers, duplicates, and missing values
- Handle and familiarize with large data with multiple problems such as skewed numericals, high-cardinality etc.
- Structuring machine learning processes with scikit-learn pipelines
- Feature Engineering processes
